            XRP (the "<strong>Loan</strong>"). The Loan is evidenced by a promissory note
            effective on the same date as this agreement (the "<strong>Note</strong>"), a copy of
            which is attached as <strong>Exhibit A</strong>. The Note and this agreement are
            collectively referred to as the "<strong>Loan Documents</strong>."
        </p>

        <p id="left">To induce the Lender to provide Loan to the Borrower as evidenced by the Note,
            the Borrower has agreed to enter into this security agreement for the benefit of the
            Lender and to grant the Lender a security interest in the Secured Property (as defined
            below) to secure the prompt payment, performance, and discharge in full of the
            Borrower's obligations under the Note.</p>

        <p align-text="left">The parties therefore agree as follows:</p>
        <p><strong>1. GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST.</strong></p>
        <p>The Borrower grants to the Lender a security interest in the Secured Property (as defined
            in section 2 below) to secure payment of the Loan.</p>

        <p><strong>2. SECURED PROPERTY.</strong></p>
        <p>The secured property consists of all of the Borrower's interest as of the effective date
            of this agreement in the following properties and rights, wherever located, whether now
            owned or existing or later acquired and arising (the "<strong>Secured Property</strong>"):

        <strong><label id="securedProperty"></label></strong>
        <textarea rows="5" cols="100" id="securedPropertyField" name="text"></textarea>
        <button class="button-save" id='securedPropertyButton' type='button'>save</button>

        <p><strong>3. INDEBTEDNESS.</strong></p>
        <p>This agreement is made to secure payment when due of the Loan. The Loan includes:</p>
        <p>(a) all obligations of the Borrower to the Lender under the Note;</p>
        <p>(b) all amendments, renewals, or extensions of the above;</p>
        <p>(c) all costs incurred by the Lender in establishing, determining, continuing, or
            defending the validity or priority of its security interest, or in pursuing its rights
            under this agreement or any other Loan Document or in connection with any proceeding
            involving the Lender as a result of any financial accommodation to the Borrower; and</p>
        <p>(d) all other costs of collecting the Loan, including attorneys' fees.</p>

        <p>The Borrower shall reimburse the Lender for these expenses immediately on demand, and
            until paid all costs shall bear interest at the highest per year rate applicable to the
            Loan and permitted by law.</p>
        <p><strong>4. REAFFIRMATION OF LOAN.</strong></p>
        <p>The Borrower hereby reaffirms its obligation for the full and punctual payment and
            performance of the Note and all other obligations of the Borrower under the Note.</p>
        <p><strong>5. BORROWER'S OBLIGATIONS.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>(a) The Borrower shall pay the Loan at the time and in the manner provided in the
                Note;</li>
            <li>(b) The Borrower shall ensure that the Secured Property remains free of all security
                interests other than the rights of the Lender created by this agreement;</li>
            <li>(c) The Borrower will defend the Lender's interest in the Secured Property against
                the claims of all other persons; and</li>
            <li>(d) The Borrower may not transfer any Secured Property while this agreement is in
                effect without the prior written consent of the Lender, which consent may be
                withheld or given in the Lender's sole discretion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>6. RECORDING OF AGREEMENT.</strong></p>
        <p>On the effective date of this agreement, the Borrower will record this agreement and any
            security instrument creating a security interest on the Secured Property as required by
            law to protect the security interest of the Lender on the Secured Property. The Borrower
            shall pay all filing fees and associated expenses incident to this recordation.</p>
        <p><strong>7. EVENTS OF DEFAULT.</strong></p>
        <p>The Borrower will be in default under this agreement if any of the following occurs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>(a) A default in the payment of the Loan or any of the obligations contained in this
                agreement or in the Loan Documents;</li>
            <li>(b) Any representation made to the Lender by the Borrower proving to have been false
                in any material respect when made;</li>
            <li>(c) Loss, theft, substantial damage, or destruction, or any sale or encumbrance to
                which the Lender did not consent in writing, of the Secured Property, or the making
                of a levy, seizure, or attachment on that property; or</li>
            <li>(d) An Event of Default, as defined in the Note.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>8. REMEDIES FOR EVENTS OF DEFAULT.</strong></p>
        <p>If an Event of Default occurs, the Lender may declare the Loan immediately due. In
            addition, the Lender will have all of the remedies set forth below, and these remedies
            are cumulative, so that the Lender may exercise one or more of these remedies until the
            Loan is paid in full without right of reinstatement, disgorgement, or repayment by
            reason of a preference, other creditor action, or by operation of law:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>(a) cause all or any portion of the Secured Property to be registered in its name or
                the name of its nominee, designee, or assignee;</li>
            <li>(b) have the exclusive right to receive all distributions with respect to the
                Secured Property;</li>
            <li>(c) dispose of the Secured Property, at private or public sale, without
                advertisement of the time or place of the sale (or any adjournment), free of any
                right of redemption by the Borrower (this right of redemption being expressly waived
                by the Borrower), at the price, in the manner, and to the purchaser (including the
                Lender) that the Lender determines in its sole discretion. The proceeds of this sale
                will be applied to the Loan and the sale expenses (and the Borrower will remain
                liable for any deficiencies); or</li>
            <li>(d) all other rights and remedies arising under this agreement or applicable law.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>9. RESPONSIBILITY FOR SECURED PROPERTY.</strong></p>
        <p>The Borrower assumes all responsibility for the Secured Property, and the Loan will not
            be affected by the loss, destruction, damage, or theft of any of the Secured Property or
            its unavailability for any reason. The Lender</p>
        <ul>
            <li>(a) has no duty (either before or after an Event of Default) to collect any amounts
                related to the Secured Property or to preserve any rights relating to the Secured
                Property, and</li>
            <li>(b) has no obligation to clean up or otherwise prepare the Secured Property for
                sale.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Borrower remains obligated under each agreement included in the Secured Property. The
            exercise of the Lender of any rights under this agreement does not release the Borrower
            from its obligations under the agreements included in the Secured Property. The Lender
            has no liability under the agreements included in the Secured Property.</p>
        <p><strong>10. TERMINATION.</strong></p>
        <p>This agreement and all rights of the Lender under this agreement will terminate when the
            Lender is satisfied that the Loan and all other obligations of the Borrower under the
            Loan Documents are paid and performed in full without reinstatement, disgorgement, or
            repayment by reason of a preference, other credit or action, or operation of law.</p>
        <p><strong>11. INCONSISTENCIES.</strong></p>
        <p>If any provision of this agreement is inconsistent with any provision in the Note, the
            provisions of [this agreement| the promissory note"] will control.</p>
        <p><strong>12. GOVERNING LAW.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>(a) <strong>Choice of Law.</strong> The laws of the state of [Choose State] govern
                this agreement (without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles).</li>
            <li>(b) <strong>Choice of Forum</strong>. Both parties consent to the personal
                jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in [Choose County].</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>13. AMENDMENTS.</strong></p>
        <p>No amendment to this agreement will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by
            both parties.</p>
        <p><strong>14. ASSIGNMENT AND DELEGATION.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>(a) <strong>No Assignment.</strong> The Borrower may not assign any of its rights
                under this note. All voluntary assignments of rights are limited by this subsection.
            </li>
            <li>(b) <strong>No Delegation.</strong> The Borrower may not delegate any performance
                under this note.</li>
            <li>(c) <strong>Enforceability of an Assignment or Delegation.</strong> If a purported
                assignment or purported delegation is made, or if both are made, in violation of
                this section, it is void and they are void.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>15. COUNTERPARTS; ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>(a) <strong>Counterparts.</strong> The parties may execute this agreement in any
                number of counterparts, each of which is an original but all of which constitute one
                and the same instrument.</li>
            <li>(b) <strong>Electronic Signatures.</strong> This agreement, agreements ancillary to
                this agreement, and related documents entered into in connection with this agreement
                are signed when a party's signature is delivered by facsimile, email, or other
                electronic medium. These signatures must be treated in all respects as having the
                same force and effect as original signatures.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>16. SEVERABILITY.</strong></p>
        <p>If any one or more of the provisions contained in this agreement is, for any reason, held
            to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, that invalidity, illegality, or
            unenforceability will not affect any other provisions of this agreement, but this
            agreement will be construed as if those invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provisions
            had never been contained in this agreement, unless the deletion of those provisions
            would result in such a material change as to cause completion of the transactions
            contemplated by this agreement to be unreasonable.</p>
        <p><strong>17. NOTICES.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>(a) <strong>Writing; Permitted Delivery Methods</strong>. Each party giving or
                making any notice, request, demand, or other communication required or permitted by
                this agreement shall give that notice in writing and use one of the following types
                of delivery, each of which is a writing for purposes of this agreement: personal
