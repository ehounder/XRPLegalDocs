## Standard Legal Form Transactions on XRP Ledger

[XRPLegalDocs](xrplegaldocs.com) is operating on the XRP Ledger mainnet wherein users fill out a standard **Security Agreement** form as on **LegalZoom** or **RocketLawyer** involving a Lender and Buyer detailing the secured property and terms of the Loan. To sign the contract however, instead of signing and recording the contract by conventional means, XRPLegalDocs utilizes XRPL Escrow transactions and **Xumm** wallet signing of the contract simultaneous with transfer of the XRP Loan from Lender to Borrower. Thus the two parties meet with legal counsel as usual wherein the Lender creates and funds the escrow and Borrower signs the agreement receiving the Loan with the transaction hash recorded in a PDF download - in a matter of seconds while everybody is still sitting at the conference table.

Future development involves extending the PDF downloads to minting the PDFs into NFTs in the cases where the parties choose to make the contracts public records, taking into account of course the extra steps required to create accounts for the NFTs, for example, such as the transaction sequence of the Sologenic securities registered DEX.

## DeFi and Financial Inclusion Drives Scaled-Up Utility

The present direct peer to peer distributed blockchain financing, i.e. DeFi, meets the definition of financial inclusion and follows through with the potential for scaling as can be immediately realized. Regarding which XRPLegalDocs operates entirely in the browser without backend hence of lightest weight for scaling. Brave, Safari, and Chrome handle the downloads with ease.

Hooks amendment ratification would establish basis for monetization of the business model via partial payments for the downloads and NFTs. Accordingly Hooks would also establish the basis for an employee-owned business plan wherein the lowest number of employees receive partial payments in return for success in developing and governing the best product marketshare.
